The rest of an HTTP url after the host name and optional port number is completely opaque to the client: The client may make no deductions about the object from its URL.',

Activities are where the user will interact with your app - they provide a window for your view and an interface for detecting input from the user and displaying output. Each app may have several activities that the user switches between while the app is running. \n\n Programmatically, each activity is typically made up of: \n * A Java class, e.g. MainActivity.java. \n * An XML resource file that defines your activity\'s layout, e.g. activity_main.xml. \n * An entry in AndroidManifest.xml that registers your activity so that it may be invoked by the system.',

It only fills the amount of space required for the message and does not remove the current activity from the foreground or block interaction. A Toast will automatically disappear after a short timeout, defined by the duration argument (e.g. Toast.LENGTH_SHORT or Toast.LENGTH_LONG).',

    lecture: 'Summary: Tensorflow (TF) is Google‚Äôs attempt to put the power of Deep Learning into the hands of developers around the world. It comes with a beginner & an advanced tutorial, as well as a course on Udacity. However, the materials attempt to introduce both ML and TF concurrently to solve a multi-feature problem‚Ää‚Äî‚Äächaracter recognition, which albeit interesting, unnecessarily convolutes understanding. In this series of articles, we present the gentlest introduction to TF that starts off by showing how to do linear regression for a single feature problem, and expand from there.',
